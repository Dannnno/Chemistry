This repository is designed to use Python in the simulation of organic chemistry reactions.  The program has several specific goals in particular:

1. Display an interactive periodic table of the elements that will display basic but key information regarding elements
2. Display a GUI interface that permits the easy depiction of chemical structures
3. Predict reaction pathways and product ratios based on the information provided by the user
4. Perform basic retrosynthetic analysis of compounds
5. Name compounds as per both the IUPAC and Common standards
6. Store important data on the device in question or on the cloud
7. More cool stuff TBD
    
Current stage of development: Pre-Alpha  
Current version: NA  
Currently projected date of Alpha release: Soon<sup>TM</sup>
