The purpose of this repository is to organize the (currently untitled) program.  The (eventual) goal of this program is to create an application that uses
Python to allow intro level Organic Chemistry students to construct simple (and hopefully somewhat complex) molecules and predict their interactions.  

Goals of this program:

1. Create an **interactive** periodic table of the elements that will display basic but key information regarding elements
2. Be able to create a GUI interface that permits the drawing of compounds
3. Be able to predict reactions and major/minor products of several types of reactions
4. Be able to perform **basic** retrosynthetic analysis of molecules
5. Be able to name compounds as per **IUPAC** standards
6. Be able to store selected data either on a hard drive or on the internet
7. More cool stuff TBD
    
Current stage of development: Pre-Alpha  
Current version: NA  
Currently projected date of Alpha release: In a long time
