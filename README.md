The purpose of this repository is to organize the (currently untitled) program.  The (eventual) goal of this program is to create a Java based GUI
interface that will rely on a Python background, allowing intro level Organic Chemistry students to construct simple (and hopefully complex) molecules
and predict their interactions.  

Goals of this program:

1. Create an **interactive** periodic table of the elements that will display basic but key information regarding elements
2. Be able to calculate the molar mass of compounds
3. Be able to create a GUI interface that permits the drawing of compounds
4. Be able to predict reactions and major/minor products of several types of reactions
5. Be able to perform **basic** retrosynthetic analysis of molecules
5. Be able to name compounds as per **IUPAC** standards
6. Be able to store selected data either on a hard drive or on the internet
7. More cool stuff TBD
    
Current stage of development: Pre-Alpha  
Current version: NA  
Currently projected date of Alpha release: late 2014-early 2015
