"""Primarily used (or will be primarily used) as a middle layer between the
program and any GUI developed for it, as well as for public use (individuals
who only want to import the framework and then use it for their own needs), and
lastly in any command line interface this program eventually has.

The name of the package and the modules within suck.  Will be rewritten,
eventually.
