The purpose of this repository is to organize the (currently untitled) program.  The (eventual) goal of this program is to create a GUI
interface that will rely on a Python background, allowing Chemistry students to construct simple (or hopefully complex) molecules
and predict their interactions.  

Goals of this program:
    - Create an interactive periodic table of the elements that will display basic but key information regarding elements
    - Be able to calculate the molar mass of compounds
    - Be able to create a GUI interface that permits the drawing of compounds
    - Be able to predict reactions and major/minor products of several types of reactions
    - Be able to name compounds as per IUPAC standards
    - Be able to store selected data either on a hard drive or on the internet
    - More TBD
    
Current stage of development - Pre-Alpha
Current version - NA
Expected date of Alpha release - a long time from now (late 2014-early 2015?)
