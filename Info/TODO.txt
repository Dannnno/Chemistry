TODO List - updated 1/12/2014
    
GitHub:
    - Understand how GitHub works
        - pushing, commiting, etc
        - Especially branches
    - Look into private repository    

MarkDown:
    - Learn about markdown and convert README.txt to README.md
    - Potentially convert other *.txt files to *.md files
    
GUI:
    - Create Main Window
    - Create Menu options (File, Edit, Options, Help, etc)
    - Compound creation support
       - Bond type support
       - atom type rupport
       - radical support
       - lpe support 
       - Charge support
            - should open with a single Carbon as the default compound
    - create a function near(clickLoc) that finds the nearest existing object and returns
      it if the distance is within a certain pixel tolerance
    - display currently selected button/function
    - Connect the GUI with the underlying framework (pretty pictures -> actual compounds)
        - TestMolecule should have several characteristics
            -snap() - fit things to nice lines, appropriate bond lengths, etc
            -autofill() - fill octet
                -Carbons get C-H bonds
                -All others get lone pair electrons
            -autocalc() - determine formal charge
            -resonate() - find resonance
            -progress() - show a progress bar
            -finish() - display the finished molecule (if possible),
             display errors in feedback if necessary, name according
             to IUPAC standards
        - PublishMolecule should save the molecule's information
          somewhere
    - Should be a way to save current work without publishing molecule
    
Classes:
    - Chemistry (Initial support)
        - Element (Initial support)
        - Compound (Initial support)
        - Resonance (Not Started)
        - Bonds (Initial support)
        - Lone pairs (Not started)
        - IUPAC (Not started)
        - Reactions
            - Acid (Not started)
            - Base (Not started)
    - More to come
    
Long term:
    - Name project
    - Create .exe
    - Port to mobile devices
        - iOS first
            - learn Obj. C
        - Android
